# PicoORM

PicoORM: a very lightweight ORM for PHP >=7.1

## Background

Back in 2010, I was building a hosted VOIP PBX that required a LOT of calls to the database.  I wanted to make
it as simple as I could without having to import a huge ORM (you know which ones I'm talking about).  I wrote this
code and have been making continual enhancements over the years to it.
